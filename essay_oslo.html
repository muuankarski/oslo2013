<p><strong>abstract</strong>: Since 1989, the divide between Europe's East and West has been evident in terms of poverty and social and economical inequality. Over the transition period the between-nation inequalities have declined in the enlarged EU, while the regional inequalities have increased within most of the countries, especially within European post-socialist countries. As a result most of the economic inequalities today in enlarged EU are already inequalities within nations. An evident outcome of these increasing regional disparities is that poverty is becoming more and more rooted in place. This seminar paper approaches poverty outcomes of social assistance from regional perspective. It addresses the question, to what extend socially targeted benefits can alleviate poverty that varies spatially. Preliminary analysis are conducted on social assistance benefits using 2008 EU-silc data from Poland and Austria.</p>
<h1 id="introduction"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>Regional economic disparities in European Union have received substantial scholarly attention in recent years. Focus has been either on descriptive analysis and methodology <span class="citation">(Stewart 2002,<span class="citation"></span>,<span class="citation"></span>; Beckfield 2009; Longford et al. 2010)</span> or on links between regional disparities and economic growth. <span class="citation">(Perugini and Martino 2008; Ezcurra 2009; Peters, Sprout, and Melzig 2010)</span>. In terms of inequality studies are showing similar figures: among the countries of current European Union (EU) the between-country disparities have been falling over the last 20 years, while the regional inequalities within most of the countries have increased, especially within European post-socialist countries. As a result most of the economic inequalities today in enlarged EU are already inequalities within nations.</p>
<p>Levelling of these disparities has become an important goal for EU cohesion policies as stated in Article 158 in the Treaty of European Union: &gt;In particular, the Community shall aim at reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and the backwardness of the least favoured regions or islands, including rural areas. <span class="citation">(p. 118, EU 2006)</span>.</p>
<p>Currently over 60 % of EU structural Fund budget is targeted to regions lagging behind the EU average in GDP per capita <span class="citation">(p. 2, Longford et al. 2010)</span>. Impact of these regional policies on disparities have been covered in various studies in terms of convergence of per capita income<span class="citation">(Pittau and Zelli 2006; Quah 1996)</span> but only among the countries of EU15. According to <span class="citation">(p. 2, Longford et al. 2010)</span> the income disparities across regions in EU15 countries have narrowed over time, but this trend cannot be equated with reduction of disparities within regions.</p>
<p>As the EU cohesion funds are targeted at the regional level on the basis of GDP per capita, can the analysis of disparities between regional averages be misleading and more attention should be paid on intra regional individual or household level variations. Nevertheless, according to <span class="citation">(p. 541-542, Rynck and McAleavey 2001)</span> reduction of economic inequalities at the micro level is an implicit aim for European Comission. In addition to EU policies, there are also various national level policy instruments aiming either directly or indirectly for the same. State allocates resources directly through set of policies named <em>fiscal federalism</em> <span class="citation">(see, Oates 1977)</span>, while subsidies on certain trades may have indirect redistributive effect, eg. EU agricultural subsidies <span class="citation">(see, Hansen 2007)</span>. Main policy instrument for reducing micro level income inequalities is income redistribution systems, which is in question in this seminar paper. And more precisely, this paper addresses the question, how single welfare programme, social assistance, reduces spatially varying poverty?</p>
<h2 id="towards-a-spatial-approach-to-poverty"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Towards a spatial approach to poverty</h2>
<p>Analysis of poverty in social policy depart of with an study of how characteristics of individual or families are connected with higher or lower risks of poverty. Such micro level explanations are found in most account of poverty. Less often, attention is given to how contexts - spatial or temporal, may affect the poverty risks. Temporal variation due to recession, changes in state policies and other fluctuations are given some attention in the literature and sometimes treated as major theoretical subjects <span class="citation">(Gundersen and Ziliak 2004)</span>. According to <span class="citation">(Cotter, Hermsen, and Vanneman 2007)</span> the territorial variation of economic production has been addressed less often, though recognized by both scholars and policy makers. Referring to <span class="citation">(Tickamyer 2000)</span> they claim that attention to spatial variation is especially important because of the substantial variation in economic structure and poverty policies across places, and which may widen over time [p. 164,cotter2007placing].</p>
<p><span class="citation">(p. 3-5, Lobao, Hooks, and Tickamyer 2007)</span> elaborates the importance of scale of spatial analysis. Well-developed bodies of research on poverty and other inequalities are found mainly at two opposing scales: the city or local level and across the global system of nation-states, there in between is a <em>missing middle</em>, territorial, regional or subnational spatial scale.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Insofar as the sociological imagination has been drawn largely to cities and nation-states, we are left with disciplinary gaps: large swathe of places, people, and substantive topics are left out of systematic investigations because they do not fall into the usual categories by which sociologist carve up space. <span class="citation">(p. 4, Lobao, Hooks, and Tickamyer 2007)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Spatial scale is important because it defines the territorial domain from which processes creating inequality arises. Also, it can be seen as the arena for targeting policy and political action.</p>
<p><em>Sociology as a discipline began with a core interest in the relationship between space and social organisation</em> claims Michael <span class="citation">(p. 86., Irwin 2007)</span> and refers to early 20th century classics. He states that proliferation of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software and release of census data and other geographically aggregated data and the development of spatial statistics has accelerated the territorially based analysis. Locating data about social conditions in place allows a wide range of (spatial) data to be linked with the analysis. Not only details on regional economy and job markets, but also about geographical conditions like distance or climate, access to services, infrastructure etc.</p>
<p>EU regional funding and state fiscal federalism are targeted primarily spatially, while social assistance is targeted socially. Spatial or geographical targeting is practised when the aim of intervention is defined in spatial terms as region, while social targeting when aim is defined in social terms as poverty. By nature, poverty can be seen both as social and spatial. Mechanisms creating poverty can be rooted both in socio-economical or in spatial structures of society. Various socio-economic factors as social class, age, gender, income level are often linked with variations in poverty, but less often is poverty is linked with spatial factors eg. regional economy or unemployment, access to education, health care or regional concentration of social factors(risks).</p>
<p>It may be claimed that spatial analysis of socially targeted policies as social assistance has no relevance as it is <em>social</em>, not <em>spatial</em> assistance. Among social benefits, social assistance has it's specific function in protection against poverty. And that is where rationality arises: as poverty is rooted in social structures it is also rooted in place, should social programs aimed at alleviating poverty analysed both, in terms of social and spatial effectiveness. Another question is, of course, whether social targeted benefit can alleviate spatial poverty?</p>
<h2 id="post-social-transition-and-geographies-of-poverty"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Post-social transition and geographies of poverty</h2>
<p>Spatial emphasis of poverty in this paper is closely linked with post-socialist transition and dynamics of poverty during the last twenty years. The breakdown of socialist system had a dramatic effect on poverty and inequality in all of the countries. since the collapse of the Soviet Union the number of poor people increased from 14 million to nearly 150 million by the mid-1990. In the same period the countries with very equal income distribution experienced a dramatic rose in income inequality resulting in inequality levels similar to Latin American countries. <span class="citation">(p. 67-71. Milanović 1998)</span>.</p>
<p>As text for this chapter is not ready at the moment, there are two figures telling part of the story. Current regional economic disparities are plotted on a map in figure 1. The divide between West and East is clear (map A), as is the fact that many regions in Eastern Europe are catching up (map B). Map C portraits the regional extremes (50 poorest and wealthiest regions). Figure 1 is followed by figure 2 illustrating the regional variations in terms if income. maps A and B show disposable income, while map C presents the relative level of primary (market) income in relation to EU27 average. Map D sheds light into the redistribution of incomes and show share of disposable income of market incomes. The further away from green the region is the less there is redistribution within that nation state.</p>
<p>Before the analysis some hypothesis can be drawn, though they can't be adequately tested in the current setting. Firstly, it is assumed that *spatial impact} of social assistance is low in all of the countries. In addition, as there is more absolute poverty (housing deficiencies, fuel poverty) in Eastern Europe (degradation of infrastructure) the assistance from social benefits makes little difference for spatial disparities. While poor regions are getting more run down, the net impact of income redistribution is not able slow down the process.</p>
<h1 id="data-methods"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Data &amp; Methods</h1>
<p>My analytical framework is grounded on the recommendations of Canberra Group with two distinctive characteristics drawn from transition research. First, special emphasis is put on space and spatial dimension at the regional or &quot;subnational&quot; scale where much of inequality is rooted. Second, relative, income based measures of poverty are challenged with energy poverty as an indicator of more absolute deficiencies in living standards. GIS-software and cartographic illustrations [quantum_2011} are used to combine the spatial and socioeconomical aspects of analysis. Household level data from EU-SILC is used as main data frame for social indicators.</p>
<h2 id="eu-silc-and-eurostat-regional-statistics"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> EU-silc and Eurostat regional statistics</h2>
<p>The data on which the analysis are based come from the EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) for 2008. EU-SILC provides comparable, cross-sectional and longitudinal multi-dimensional data on income, poverty, social exclusion and living conditions in the European Union. EU-SILC is conducted by the member states of the European Union and coordinated by Eurostat. Dataset consist of cross-sectional and longitudinal data including variables on income, poverty, social exclusion, housing and other living conditions. Data on income and social benefits are collected both at household and individual level. Household data includes aggregates for gross and disposable income and household related social benefits.</p>
<p>Indicators of poverty and social exclusions in EU-silc datasets was designed primarily to serve analysis at the national level. Recently, there has been growing interest on applying dataset in regional analysis both from methodological <span class="citation">(Verma, Betti, and Gagliardi 2010; Bonerandi-Richard, Mélodie, and Luc 2011)</span> and analytical <span class="citation">(Reinstadler and Jean-Claude 2010)</span> perspectives. Main problem arises from possible sampling errors when breaking a nationally representative sample into regional sub-samples. Is necessary to focus on most basic indicators among the Laeken indicators when breaking them down to regional level as the data breakdown itself increases the data requirements. Further narrow disaggregation of data (by age, gender, eg.) simultaneously with regional breakdown has to be applied with caution. In addition, regional breakdown limits the possibilities to study trends over time to cross-sectional measures.[Verma, Betti, and Gagliardi <span class="citation">(2010)</span>}</p>
<p>There are various projects dealing with this issue in EU-silc as EURAREA Project (2001-2004), SAMPLE Project (2008-2011)and AMELI Project (2008-2011) and Eurostat has recently published a good overview of this issue by <span class="citation">(see, Verma and Betti 2010)</span> <span class="citation">(See also, Verma, Betti, and Gagliardi 2010)</span>. To address these issues  have written a package &quot;simPopulation&quot; for R for microsimulation procedure to improve the robustness of indicators in subgroups. Combined with package &quot;laeken&quot; by Andreas Alfons, Josef Holzer and Matthias Templ <span class="citation">(see more, Templ and Alfons 2011a; Templ and Alfons 2011b; Templ et al. 2011)</span> for robust analysis of social exclusion indicators in EU-silc provides solid statistical means for proceeding.</p>
<h2 id="unit-of-region"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Unit of region</h2>
<p>The choice of unit of region is the first step when when pursuing a regional level analysis. In the geographical context of EU a there are numerous substantial and practical reasons for choosing the Nomenclature of Units for Territorial Statistics (NUTS)<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> geographical-administrative regions for social policy analysis. As  writes NUTS regions are a) most commonly used units for the formulation and implementation of social policy, b) units are well-defined and identifiable and c) already widely accepted and used by researchers and producers of statistical information.</p>
<p>Information about geographical location of the household is far from perfect in EU-silc, but reaches NUTS2-level for some of the countries. For this seminar paper I have chosen Austria as Western European country with low regional disparities and high income, and Poland as low-income, post-socialist country with high regional disparities. My current dataset does not allow breakdown at lover level than NUTS1, which makes analysis very superficial and suggestive at best. I'm in a urgent need for a dataset with more detailed regional classification. Level NUTS2 would already allow a breakdown into units that are relevant in regard to regional variations in, for example, regional production as well as implementation of social policies.</p>
<h2 id="definitions-of-poverty"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Definitions of poverty</h2>
<p>Two different concepts of poverty will be utilized in this paper. First one follows the official EU methodology for social exclusion (laeken indicators) which is indirect and relative notion of poverty measured on national level at 60% of median income, so called <em>at-risk-of-poverty rate</em> <sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> (arpr) <span class="citation">(Atkinson et al. 2002)</span>. In addition to arpr another laeken indicator, <em>relative median at-risk-of-poverty gap</em> <sup><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3">3</a></sup> is used to capture not just extend, but also the depth of poverty.</p>
<p>The main weakness in relation to my definitions of poverty can be seen in figure 3 that illustrates the median household incomes and poverty thresholds by EU countries. Dotted lines surround the countries in this analysis and the obvious is that poverty threshold in Austria is more than double the median income in Poland. This means, of course, that the poor household in Poland has substantially lower level of material assets than the Austrian counterpart. A use of EU-wide poverty threshold could have been used to strengthen the analysis as recommended by <span class="citation">(p. 115, Atkinson et al. 2005)</span>, but was not employed at this stage. <span class="citation">(See more, Fahey 2007)</span>.</p>
<p>In addition to relative monetary indicator a non-monetary indicator of *energy poverty} is enrolled into analysis to broaden the scope of poverty. Here the definition is adopted from Stefan <span class="citation">(p. 9, Buzar 2007)</span> as <em>inability to heat home up to a socially- and materially necessitated level</em>. This definition includes both the biologically determined limit of 20 \(^\circ\)C required to maintain comfort and health [more on biological definition <span class="citation">(Boardman 1991)</span> and the subjective minimun below which an individual feels unable to perform his/her every life <span class="citation">(p. 9, Buzar 2007)</span>. Here the energy poverty is limited to the home and does not include mobility and residence outside the domestic domain. [For broader discussion on energy poverty especially within UK <span class="citation">(see, Bradshaw 1983; Boardman 1991; Rudge and Nicol 2000; Healy 2003)</span>. From EU-silc database variable <em>HH050: Ability to keep home adequately warm</em> is used as an indicator for energy poverty. Figure 4 presents the shares of households suffering from energy poverty in Poland and Austria.</p>
